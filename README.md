## What does it do?

## How does it work?

### Architecture diagram

There are two separate use cases here:

1. Example of a 3rd party chat library [getstream.io](https://getstream.io/) with real-time Salesforce Personalization
2. Example of Salesforce Agentforce chat with real-time Salesforce Personalization

The architecture is slightly different and outlined bellow.

#### 3rd Party Chat Architecture

![](./screenshots/3rd-party-architecture-diagram.png)

The application flow is the following:

**Client**

1. The user navigates to the website URL
2. The browser sends a request to the hosting server, in this case that is a Heroku dyno
3. The Heroku returns HTML and Javascript, and Javascript hydrates the website
4. During the page load, the [Data Cloud Web SDK](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.c360a_api.meta/c360a_api/c360a_api_salesforce_interactions_web_sdk.htm) also gets loaded into the website
5. Various web events get captured based on the [pre-defined web event JSON schema](./client/src/utils/data-cloud-schema.json) and custom react [useSalesforceInteractions.ts](./client/src/hooks/useSalesforceInteractions.ts) hook
6. The chat service used for this is a 3rd party library [getstream.io](https://getstream.io/)
7. As part of the website load, the chat service also gets [initialized](./client/src/components/ChatWidget/ChatCanvas.tsx)
8. Every chat message is captured by the custom [Data Cloud Web SDK event](./client/src/hooks/useSalesforceInteractions.ts#L16)
9. Additionally, on every captured chat message, a custom [notification service](./server/src/controllers/notification-service.js) endpoint gets invoked with a [deviceId](./client/src/utils/notifyAi.ts)
10. The `deviceId` is automatically generated by the Data Cloud Web SDK once the SDK is successfully loaded

**Server**

1. The web server is a [Node Express server](./server/index.js) hosted on Heroku
2. The web server uses the [Salesforce credentials](./server/.env.example) to retrieve the [authentication token](./server/src/utils/sfAuthToken.js) from Salesforce
3. With the retrieved token, a [Data Graph is invoked](./server/src/controllers/notification-service.js#23) based on the provided `deviceId`
4. The retrieved data from the Data Graph then gets [parsed](./server/src/utils/parseDataGraphData.js)
5. The parsed chat messages and the `deviceId` get send to the [Saleforce Flow via an API call](./server/src/controllers/notification-service.js#54)
